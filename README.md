# MoogleTomeTracker

A small program for tracking which tomestones you need for the current cycle.

To use, just copy the web site link for the Moogle Teasure Trove page. (ie. https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/special/mogmog-collection/202207/ujz24q0uim)
This is the link for the July 2022 MTT. As long as the template for the webpage doesn't change, it should work for future Treasure Troves. If not, come back to this site and I should be able to get an update going.

Once you have the items on the second tab, you can select which you want to track. On the first tab it will show a running total of the Irregular Tomestones you need, once you mark an item off it will update the new total.
